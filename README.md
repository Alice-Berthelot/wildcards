WildCardS is the first group project I participated in during my training at the Wild Code School. I had less than a month of experience learning coding. 

Concept: photo directory of the Wild Code School, Bordeaux Campus, turned into a fun and interactive experience, repesented as collectible cards. French language.

Team: 4 students in web development (Franck Galliod, Axel Janiak, Chris LeJeune and me)

Check out how it looks here:

My achievements: 
- created a JSON file and linked it to js and html files ;
- developed dynamic creation of the cards by building generic JavaScript functions and utilizing JavaScript methods ;
- implemented a filter: users can click on filter buttons (representing different teams) to display only the desired cards ; 
- enabled dynamic style changes: change of the selected filter button, the background image and the logo in the navbar according to the userâ€™s team selection ;
- built a responsive function to adapt dynamic style changes based on screen width ;
- developed a searchbar comparing user input with card names to filter results ; 
- implemented a go-back button ; 
- contributed to creating 'index.html' and responsive CSS code. 

Main area for improvement: refactor the JavaScript code

Note: I changed the import type for the json file into a 'fetch' to ensure it is working correctly

Deployment coming soon!
